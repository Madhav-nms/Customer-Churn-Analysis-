## Executive Summary

Analyzed **7,000+ telecom customer records** to identify churn drivers and retention opportunities. Built predictive models (**Logistic Regression, Random Forest**) with ~80% accuracy, ran **A/B tests** to validate strategies, and proposed actions projected to **reduce churn by 20% annually**. Delivered insights through **Power BI dashboards** for real-time decision-making.

## Project Overview

Customer churn is one of the most critical challenges for subscription based businesses. Retaining existing customers is **5–7x cheaper** than acquiring new ones. By predicting churn and understanding its drivers, telecom and insurance companies can reduce losses and boost customer lifetime value.  

---

## Business Objectives  

- Identify **which customers are at risk of leaving**.  
- Understand **why customers churn** (contract, payment, services).  
- Develop **retention strategies** supported by A/B testing.  
- Enable **real-time monitoring** via dashboards.  

---

##  KPIs Tracked

- **Churn Rate** – % of customers leaving per cycle.  
- **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** – projected revenue per user.  
- **Average Tenure** – length of customer relationship.  
- **Retention Cost vs Acquisition Cost** – ROI of strategies.  

---

## Key Insights 

- Customers on **month-to-month contracts** were **3x more likely** to churn.  
- **Electronic check users** showed the **highest churn rate**.  
- Customers with **tenure <12 months** represented the **largest at risk group**.  
- Value added services (e.g., Online Security, Tech Support) reduced churn probability.  

---

## Predictive Modeling  

- **Logistic Regression** for interpretability.  
- **Random Forest** for performance -- Achieved ~80% accuracy.  
- Feature importance showed **contract type, tenure, and payment method** as strongest predictors.

---

## A/B Testing  
- Compared targeted offers (**contract upgrade discounts vs payment method incentives**).  
- **Chi-Square test confirmed significance (p < 0.05)**.  
- Contract upgrade incentives were more effective at reducing churn in simulations. 

---

## Strategic Recommendations  
1. **Contract Migration**: Incentivize month-to-month customers to move to annual plans.  
2. **Payment Optimization**: Offer discounts for switching from electronic check to autopay/credit card.  
3. **Onboarding Campaigns**: Target customers in their first 12 months with engagement perks.  
4. **Service Bundling**: Bundle Online Security/Tech Support with contracts to improve retention. 

--- 

## Business Impact  
- Retention strategies projected to **reduce churn by ~20% annually**.  
- Enhanced **forecasting of high-risk customers** with actionable segmentation.  
- Dashboards accelerated stakeholder reporting by **2x**.
